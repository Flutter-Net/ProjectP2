Flutter Description:
A social media web application based on the idea that all users can post to the same “feed” and filter the content they want to see on that wall by different means. Designed so that users can login to the application and see the “feed”. Users can also comment on posts to start a conversation with their fellow posters, these comments will only be visible while looking at that specific post. Each user will also have a profile page used to describe themselves that is unique for each user.
